# 🏠 STM32 Smart Sensing and Control System

This project is a smart sensing and control system developed using the **STM32F103C8T6** microcontroller and **STM32CubeIDE**. It integrates multiple peripherals including a **DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor**, **ultrasonic distance sensor**, **IR proximity sensor**, **servo motor**, **OLED display**, and **UART communication**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Displays real-time **temperature**, **humidity**, and **distance** on an OLED screen
- ✅ Automatically opens/closes a door (servo) based on IR sensor input
- ✅ Sends simple status signals (`'0'` or `'1'`) over **UART1** for board-to-board communication
- ✅ Clean and responsive UI with sensor icons and welcome messages on boot
- ✅ Uses **PWM**, **I2C**, **UART**, and **timers** for smooth peripheral control

## 📤 UART Communication Protocol

| Signal Sent | Meaning           |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `'0'`       | No IR object detected |
| `'1'`       | Object detected (door open) |
